# scanpix

scanpix is a `local Google Photos`. It allows you to search local images and videos using text. I love the features of Google Photos, but don't like that I have to send them all my pictures, and that I'm at their mercy for new features.

## Ultimate goal
- Link your local file storage or Dropbox/Drive 
- Create indexes for images/videos in the background
- App to search for images/videos using text
- Extend to a general `metadata(file)` -> `semantic search` paradigm
